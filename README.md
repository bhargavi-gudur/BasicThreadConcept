# Basic_threadConcept
A simple demonstration of multithreading concepts in C++ including thread creation, synchronization, and basic examples using std::thread and std::mutex.
# Basic Thread Concept in C++
## Description
This repository is a collection of examples demonstrating the fundamental concepts of **multithreading** in C++ using the `<thread>` library. The focus is on helping beginners understand how to create and manage threads, synchronize access to shared resources, and explore concurrency in modern C++.

The repository covers:
- Thread creation and execution
- Thread management using `join()` and `detach()`
- Synchronization techniques using `std::mutex` to handle shared resources
- Passing arguments to threads for flexible task execution

This project serves as a learning resource for anyone looking to understand multithreading basics and apply them in real-world applications.

## Repository Details
- **Thread Basics**: Learn how to create threads and manage their lifecycle.
- **Synchronization**: Avoid race conditions using mutual exclusion (`std::mutex`) and other synchronization mechanisms.
- **Parameterized Threads**: Understand how to pass arguments to thread functions for customized behavior.
- **Thread Safety**: Examples ensuring thread-safe operations to avoid unpredictable behavior in concurrent applications.

Each example is simple, well-documented, and structured to help you build foundational knowledge step by step.
